Title: About

Intro: Hey, I'm Sarah!

Text: I'm a designer, developer and artist working out of my sunny Brooklyn kitchen. Lover of leafy greens, rare steak, strong coffee, a certain Black Flag album on vinyl, and a cold swim after a long hike. If I haven't told you enough facts, there's a pretty embarrassing video of me skydiving just a quick Google away.

From here you can check out my cv and projects. You're watching the skydiving video tho, aren't you? -_-

Title: Jordan + LJ

----

Summary: A digital wedding invitation for a ~very cool~ pair.

Role: web design & development

Text:

It was so fun creating this wedding site for Laura Jo Hess and Jordan Yearsley. My favorite part of the project was incorporating the blind-contour drawings created by the couple into the design of the site.

----

Process:
The script font reinforces the style of the drawings, and the main typeface was inspired by Laura Jo, a poet, who hand-typed all of the wedding signage on her typewriter.

----

Journey:
(To be totally honest, my real goal was to get invited to the party. They said yes!)

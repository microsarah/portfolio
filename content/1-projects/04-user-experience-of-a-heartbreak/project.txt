Text:

A series of animations documenting the ways in which our use of and feelings toward technology might change during a breakup, and how couples can remain digitally intertwined after separating. It questions the inhumane nature of algorithms and their overwhelming presence in our everyday lives & interactions.

We have parted. Our ties are severed. But the internet remembers us.

Process:
Inspired by true events, the project began when I decided to document moments of discomfort during a breakup. In the smallest ways, technology seemed to have preserved our relationship (and its demise) in some sort of limbo– with what had become superficial connections.

----

Journey:
The project is purposefully anonymous, but I enjoyed incorporating subtle personal details like our number of mutual friends.

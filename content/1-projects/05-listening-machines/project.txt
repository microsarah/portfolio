I was delighted to design the identity and website for <a href="http://www.katilondon.com/" target="blank">Kati London</a> + <a href="http://www.katecrawford.net/" target="blank">Kate Crawford</a>'s Listening Machines: a one-day summit 'to address the new era of consumer listening devices.' The summit was supported by <a href="http://nytlabs.com/" target="blank">The New York Times Research & Development group</a> and <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/" target="blank">Microsoft Research</a>.

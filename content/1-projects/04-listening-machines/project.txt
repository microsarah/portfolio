I'd always be humbled to work on something that comes from the minds of <a href="http://www.katilondon.com/" target="blank">Kati London</a> + <a href="http://www.katecrawford.net/" target="blank">Kate Crawford</a>, so I was delighted to design the identity and website for Listening Machines; a "special one-day summit in New York City to address the new era of consumer listening devices."

I incorporated images of various 'listening machines' used in history in contrast with the contemporary subject matter of the conference to draw attention to the fact that while we used to create machines we used to listen in different ways, we now create machines that listen to us. Machines of the past were large, bulky, and cumbersomeâ€“ but machines of the present are subtle and oftentimes obscure enough we don't even recognize that they're recording audio of us.

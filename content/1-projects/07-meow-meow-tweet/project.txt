Meow Meow Tweet is a NY-based organic skincare company run by the fantastic Tara Pelletier and Jeff Kurosaki. In our six years working together, Tara and I have developed an enviably strong collaborative relationship. The packages, which feature Jeff's lovely illustrations, are truly a child of our collective brains.

Text:

A sweet little redesign + build for <a href="http://invibed.com" target="blank">invibed</a>, a site that offers financial advice for millennials. I was fortunate to work in tandem with the fantastic (and yes, Blissful) <a href="http://josephjbliss.com/" target="blank">Joe Bliss</a>, who provided the JavaScript and Wordpress integration.

The site has been edited since this launch, but you can view my original version <a href="http://microsarah.github.io/invibed" target="blank">here</a>.

My work at <a href="http://generalassemb.ly" target="blank">General Assembly</a> is a good representation of the range of my strengths as a product designer. I was brought on to solve problems such as enhancing the scalability and usability of our online courses,  increasing student engagement in data collection surveys, beautifying computer science graphics, and more.

The project featured below showcases a redesign for interactive code challenges in the Circuits productâ€“ an online course that uses blended learning to teach concepts like Data Analytics, Web Design, and JavaScript. The code-challenge allows the student to complete programming challenges that reinforce their learnings, as well as guide them through debugging with several tiers of error tracking, hints, and answers.

Problem: The original code-challenge tool was custom-built with the Web Design Circuit in mind, and is not scalable for developers, instructional designers, and visual designers.

[insert screenshot of old interface w/notations on issues]

[1] Content is delivered in JPGs; edits require additional production support
[2] Help section automatically gives answer; does not support independent research/learning
[3] User navigation is manual and crowded

Solutions:
[1] Develop an interface that accepts plaintext for course-agnostic content
[2] Design a system of delivery for hints and answers that support independent learning
[3] Allow student to move between steps with ease
[4] Create a visual standard for colors used in various programming languages

Because I also have experience as a web developer, I was also helpful in writing the test code that checks the students answers using <a href="http://chaijs.com/" target="blank">Chai</a>.
